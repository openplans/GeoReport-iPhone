# GeoReport iPhone

This app interacts with any [GeoReport web service](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) 
to pull/push reports from/to an [Open311](http://open311.org) service implementing the
GeoReport API.

This app is a fork of [Ushahidi's](http://www.ushahidi.com) 
[iPhone app](http://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_iPhone), which is available under the same
license (LGPL).

The customizations to work with GeoReport were developed by
[OpenPlans](http://openplans.org)
Your participation is welcome - feel free to fork, add missing features or [report issues](http://dev.ushahidi.com/projects/roadmap/Ushahidi_iPhone) :)
