App Loading & Navigation
=========================

Classes/RootViewController.m is the first view controller loaded when
the app starts. It displays the loading screen and loads the navigation
view controller, which is...

Classes/TabbarController.m implements a UITabBarController as per
http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITabBarController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UITabBarController .
Its .viewControllers property is an array of the view controllers for
each screen in the UI.

Data Model
===========

For the most part, an incident's data is represented as an NSDictionary.
This is probably somewhat because Ushahidi's API uses JSON, so it's easy
to convert to/from an NSDictionary.

The exception is when creating a new incident.
Its data is stored directly as attributes of the 
UshahidiProjAppDelegate. Dunno why. In order to post an incident
to the server, we first populate a dictionary from these attributes,
then pass that to the API class.


TO DO
=====

Save state on app unload:
  - implement this in UShahidiProjAppDelegate: applicationWillTerminate
